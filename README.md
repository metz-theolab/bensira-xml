# Ben Sira XML Files

XML files for the new transcription of the Ben Sira manuscripts by F. Rey.

The repository is structured as follow:
- `raw_files` contains the original file from the paper edition as exported from Adobe Indesign.
- `tei_files` contains the cleaned up files in TEI format. Each file bears the name of the transcribed manuscript.
- `tei_transformer` is a Python package that contains Python utilities to convert the files from the InDesign export to the clean final files.
